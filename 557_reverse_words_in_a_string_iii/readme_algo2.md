In the given solution, the second condition in the `if` statement, `(i + 1) > str.size()`, checks whether the current index `i` is at the last character of the input string `str`. This condition is necessary to handle the last word in the string.

Let's break down the condition:

- `(i + 1) > str.size()`: This condition checks if the next index, `(i + 1)`, would be greater than the size of the string. If true, it means that the current index `i` is at the last character of the input string.

When this condition is true, the `if` block will execute, reversing the last word in the string by calling `std::reverse(str.begin() + last_word_index, str.begin() + i)`. This is required because there is no space character after the last word to trigger the reversal. Without this condition, the last word in the string would not be reversed.

To summarize, the second condition in the `if` statement ensures that the last word in the input string gets reversed, even though it doesn't have a space character after it.
